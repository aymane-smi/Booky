### controllers & models test

you can check both `book_test.go` or `author_test.go` for testing or adding more test to the packages

### logging 

for logging system *Booky* uses **Zap** which a fast logger built for go.every logs are stored in ```/logs/api.log``` if you want to change the logging configurations please check ```./utils/log.go```

### monitoring

the monitoring system use **Prometheus** with 3 types of metrics:
- Counter: which used for determine number of request and errors in the whole application
- Histogram: used for display request response time

***checkout `/prometheus/prometheus.go` to see the configuration***

#### visualiation:
 you can use prometheus server(downlaod the binary file or use docker image) or use grafana.
 for grafana please run docker compose file `docker-compose up -d` and add prometheus as datasource.[you can see the docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/tutorials/visualizing_metrics_using_grafana/)

 ### Testing

 in order to make the logger work for both testing and other environment we can change ``WORK_MODE`` in `.env` file to be ```DEV``` or ```TEST``` in the following destination :
- `/models/.env`
